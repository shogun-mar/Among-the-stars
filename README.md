# Among-the-stars
Game inspired by the pygame stars example and this video by CoderSpace (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr4siL4Wktc), where the player has to resist as much as he/she can while shooting down enemy starships, travelling through hyperspace, reflecting enemy projectiles using the starship shield and shoot down special stars to gain powerups.
